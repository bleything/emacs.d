Ben Bleything's .emacs.d
========================================================================

This repo is my real `.emacs.d`. It should be noted that I'm not really
an emacs guy, but I've been trying to maintain competency for some time.

This setup is based on the work of many others, and you should check the
Credits section below for more details.

Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pretty straightforward. Just clone:

    $ git clone git://github.com/bleything/dotemacs.git ~/.emacs.d

What's Inside?!
------------------------------------------------------------------------

My own personal settings, tuned to be super rad. Also, some plugins:

* The [Emacs Lisp Package Archive](http://tromey.com/elpa), aka ELPA
* [color-theme](http://www.nongnu.org/color-theme)
* [paredit-mode](http://mumble.net/~campbell/emacs/paredit.el)
* [SLIME](http://common-lisp.net/project/slime)

Also, some color themes, all with slight modifications by me:

* [Railscasts](https://github.com/olegshaldybin/color-theme-railscasts)
* [Twilight](https://github.com/crafterm/twilight-emacs)
* [Zen and Art](https://github.com/irfn/zen-and-art)

Credits
