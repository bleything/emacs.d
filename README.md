Ben Bleything's .emacs.d
========================================================================

This repo is my real `.emacs.d`. It should be noted that I'm not really
an emacs guy, but I've been trying to maintain competency for some time.

This setup is based on the work of many others, and you should check the
Credits section below for more details.
